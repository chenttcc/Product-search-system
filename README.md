# Product Searching System

The Product Searching System is a Django-based interactive web application designed to streamline the process of product discovery and presentation. It provides users with a robust querying mechanism to search for products and tailor the results based on specific criteria. Users can specify price ranges, categories, and desired scores to refine the displayed product selection. The system offers the flexibility to sort search results based on price and score, empowering users with a personalized and efficient shopping experience. Utilizing advanced techniques such as text embedding and clustering, the system identifies and highlights the most representative comments for each product through visually appealing word clouds. Comprehensive scores for each product are intuitively depicted using radar graphs, offering users a holistic understanding of product attributes. The seamless interaction between the frontend and backend is facilitated through Ajax, ensuring a responsive and dynamic user interface.
